# photo-booth-automation
I started this project to help me operate a photo booth for an event later this year. When I found myself editing images, superimposing overlays, and printing on the fly, I said that there had to be a way to automate this. I found some pre-made software online already, but it didn't quite fit my needs so this project came to be. I hope others may find a use for this in support of some small events they may have have.

Base directory watch structure built off of [Bruno Rocha's guide](http://brunorocha.org/python/watching-a-directory-for-file-changes-with-python.html)

##### What this does:
Stacks an overlay image over incoming base images (in my use case from a tethered DSLR)

### What you'll need first
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Python PIP](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) - If you don't already have PIP, download and run `python get-pip.py`

### Get the good stuff
```
git clone https://github.com/jwu910/photo-booth-automation.git
```

### Getting it working
From `/PATH/photo-booth-automation/`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You may want to replace overlay.png with your own overlay image. Currently overlay image needs to be named overlay.png.
**Overlay image should share the same dimensions as incoming images**

*- Scalable overlay images to come in the future. -*

### Hit the ground running
Navigate to `/PATH/photo-booth-automation/` and run
```
python watch.py [path/to/watch/directory/parent]
```
Program will run in root directory if none is given.

Note: see `/tests/README.md` for testing instructions.

### Taking pictures
Once the script is running, your `watch-folder/` should be the destination directory for any pictures being taken. Adobe Lightroom tethered shooting is a great option, but I found [entangle](https://entangle-photo.org/) was a good open source alternative for Linux.

Whether you decide to use this script to support tethered shooting or you just want to stack the overlay over images as a bulk process, it could be done. Your `watch-folder/` directory will handle this completely. If you have your tethered shooting to save directly to the `watch-folder/`, the images will be processed as soon as they are taken. You can also simply drop a copy of any images to be processed in the `watch-folder/` as well.

### Custom configs
Configs are stored in `userConfigs.json`. Default folder names are included in this repository, but should you decide you want to change the directory names, update the folder names in the json file. The json file also contains the path to the overlay image being used, as well as prefix text used for file naming.
